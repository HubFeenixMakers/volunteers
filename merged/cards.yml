  :text: You can rent Hub Feenix car. The journey will take around one hour. You should
    just plan your place of parking before because the city of Helsinki is more crowded
    and cost of parking is really diverse around 4 €/ hour in the centrum. You can
    find some free parking places a little bit out of the city.

    than pay money.\r\n\r\nMostly this happends through the [workaway site](https://www.workaway.info/en/host/735959816971),
    which creates a safe space for people to meet.\r\nAfter the intial application
    (see below), we have a Video chat, using the secure [Signal App](https://www.signal.org/)"

  :text: "MESSAGING & WI-FI\r\nWe use Signal for messaging together in the Hub, so
    please download the app if you don’t have it yet, and we’ll add you to the Workaway
    group when you arrive. We have free Wi-Fi network.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SPACES\r\nOur
    aim together is to always keep the public spaces looking nice and inviting in
    Hub Feenix! There can be visitors coming to look at the place any time, so let’s
    not leave tools, cleaning equipment, our clothes or shoes etc. wondering around.\r\n\r\nDOORS\r\nAll
    the outside doors must always be kept locked. The main door can sometimes be open
    during events and courses, but only during daytime. And remember to give back
    your outdoor key when leaving! \r\n\r\nRESPECT THE PROPERTY OF HUB FEENIX\r\nEverything
    you see in Hub Feenix is always somebody’s property, that somebody has bought
    -also in the storage rooms and in the basement. So please always ask first if
    you need to take something. The food storages in the 1st floor are only for the
    use of the cafeteria/ customer kitchen. Common workaway food can be found in the
    accommodation corridor kitchen, and the room next to it. \r\n\r\nCOMPOSTING AND
    RECYCLING\r\nWe recycle all the waste we can -old food, plastic, cardboard, paper,
    metal, glass.\r\nIn Finland you get money back from empty drinking bottles and
    cans, so it’s worth taking them back to the shop and not crush them.\r\n\r\nHEATING\r\nHeating
    the big house in the winter time is very expensive, so let’s take good care of
    the heated spaces. We do our best, but it is often pretty cool indoors too. The
    best way to stay warm is to wear a lot warm clothes inside the house too -we will
    borrow you some if you need.\r\n\r\nNO CANDLES\r\nThere is an automatic fire alarm
    system in the house, so we can not burn candles or incenses inside. It costs 1000€
    if the fire brigade drives here for a false alarm.\r\n\r\nVISITORS\r\nWhen having
    visitors and showing them around, please keep only to the areas that are meant
    for the public = please don’t take visitors to the basement or the storage corridors.\r\n\r\nRENTING
    HUB FEENIX SPACES\r\nIt’s possible to rent spaces for your own interest, like
    art studio, wood workshop, treatment space etc. For the workaways, using a space
    for one hour, costs one hour of work. If heating is needed, there’s a separate
    fee for that. Agree the renting with Torsten beforehand. If you would like to
    rent a space for a longer time or for a bigger group of people, that can also
    be possible -talk to Torsten about that too.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\nAlways feel free
    to ask, if you need help or information! There are no silly questions!\r\n"

    that all the participants follow these rules of the house. The rules include also
    e.g emailing and social media. They are updated according to need.\r\n\r\nAt Hub
    Feenix, everyone is treated and addressed kindly, respectfully and equally, regardless
    of gender, color, age, nationality, profession, sexual orientation or social status.
    \r\n\r\nEveryone respects other people’s personal space and physical- and mental
    integrity.\r\nEveryone in Hub Feenix’s inside and outside premises and yards commits
    to behave in such a way, that he/she doesn't cause disturbance or shock to other
    people in the area. In public spaces everyone is always wearing clothes, and using
    swimming suite in sauna and on the swimming beach.\r\n\r\nVegetarian eating and

  :header: Info
  :text: "Hub Feenix is a non-profit centre for creativity and wellbeing, \r\nrun
    by Co-operative Hub Feenix.\r\nOur values are love of life, fairness, continuous
    learning and giving to life with all our work in Hub Feenix.\r\nWelcome to join
    the Hub!\r\n\r\nWORKAWAY DEAL\r\nFor about 5 hours of work 5 days a week you get
    basic food and accommodation. On top of this everyone participates in keeping
    the accommodation area 3A clean (we have cleaning shifts there every Wed & Sun).\r\n\r\nMEETING
    ONCE A WEEK\r\nThere’s a Workaway meeting every Monday morning 10am in the coffee
    room at 3C. Let’s meet there and talk about the works of the coming week, what’s
    happening in Hub Feenix and all the other possible things!\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND
    POSSIBILITIES\r\nHub Feenix is surrounded by beautiful nature, and you can take
    nice walks around the area. There are paths in the forest, and everyone’s free
    to use them. It’s also possible to pick berries and mushrooms. There’s a lake
    nearby, and you can take a swim, but always wear a swimming suit.\r\nThere’s also
    lots of things happening in the house. For example yoga classes (please check
    the times), \t\tlanguage lessons, Ecstatic dance evenings (10€ for the people
    of the house), riding treks in the forest (ask Maija L for prices and times).
    You´re warmly welcome to join all the activities. Some are free, some have a participation
    fee. There’s also Gym in 1B corridor that you can use freely. In the winter you
    can borrow ice skates and cross-country skis.\r\nIt´s possible to borrow a Hub
    Feenix car, for the price of 0,20€/ km. Please ask Torsten more about it (little
    driving test required before borrowing it first time).\r\nThere’s a bus stop right
    in front of the house. On the weekdays (=schooldays, some also on summer holiday
    season) busses go to Karjaa (7 km -grocery stores, post office, train station
    etc.) and to Helsinki. There’s timetables on the wall in the beginning of 1A corridor.
    You can also check them in www.matkahuolto.fi (our bus stop is Meltola, Raasepori)
    or ask Hanna! You can also ask a lift from people who have their own cars, if
    someone would have a same journey as you.\r\nThere’s couple of bikes too that
    can be borrowed. You can ask Dave more about them.\r\nSauna: please check the
    sauna times at the Workaway meeting! We’re always wearing swimming suits in the
    sauna. If the outdoor sauna is used, the firewood must be chopped so that there
    is always plenty of ready wood available (ask more from Dave).\r\nWe use Signal
    for messaging together, please download the app if you don’t have it yet, and
    we’ll add you to the Workaway group.\r\nFree Wi-Fi network is called cumulus,
    password: feenix2020\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SPACES\r\nOur aim together is to always keep
    the public spaces looking nice and inviting! There can be visitors coming to look
    at the place any time! So let’s not leave tools, cleaning equipment, our clothes
    or shoes etc. wondering around.\r\n\r\nDOORS\r\nAll the outside doors must always
    be kept locked. The main door can sometimes be open during events and courses,
    but only during daytime. And remember to give back your outdoor key when leaving!
    \r\n\r\nRESPECT THE PROPERTY OF HUB FEENIX\r\nAll of us in Hub Feenix respect
    the property of others. Everything in here is always somebody’s property, that
    somebody has bought -also in the storage rooms in the 1st floor and in the basement.
    So please always ask first if you need to take something (from Raisa or Maija
    L, tools etc. Torsten). The food storages in the 1st floor are only for the use
    of the cafeteria/ customer kitchen. Common workaway food can be found in the accommodation
    corridor 3A’s kitchen, and the room next to it. There is separate shelves and
    fridges for everyone’s private food as well as the common food -Maija L will show
    them to you.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSTING AND RECYCLING\r\nWe recycle all the waste we can
    -old food, plastic, cardboard, paper, metal, glass. You can find small recycling
    unit in our kitchen, a little bit bigger one in the storage room opposite to the
    kitchen, and the biggest ”main recycling room” in the 1B storage corridor. Mixed
    waste that cannot be recycled, goes to the big black bin in the back yard, ask
    Maija for more detailed instruction. When the bucket for composted food gets full,
    it should be emptied in the wooden compost box in the inner yard (close to saunas).
    It has 4 sections, use the one that doesn’t have a stone on it. When the bucket
    is empty, wash it in our 3A cleaning room, and then fill it 1/4 with sawdust (there’s
    a big bag in the cleaning room). \r\nIn Finland you get money back from empty
    drinking bottles and cans, so it’s worth taking them back to the shop and not
    crush them.\r\n\r\nHEATING\r\nHeating this big house in the winter time is very
    expensive, so let’s take good care of the heated spaces. Electric heaters are
    the most expensive to use (10-20€ a day!) so we use them only when really needed.
    Keep the door to your room open at the daytime, so the warm air from the air pump
    can get in. If you need to use the electric heater in the night time, always keep
    it at level ”1”, never at ”2”, and remember to switch it off for the day. You
    can also borrow an electric heat-blanket for your bed. If you need fresh air in
    your room, keep the window open only for 5mins while you’re in the room.\r\n\r\nNO
    CANDLES\r\nThere is an automatic fire alarm system in the house, so we can not
    burn candles or incenses inside. It costs 1000€ if the fire brigade drives here
    for a false alarm.\r\n\r\nWORK CLOTHES\r\nYou can borrow painting clothes and
    other work clothes. We also have lots of warm clothes to borrow - woolly shirts
    & socks, jackets, shoes etc… just ask! Also, when you need new bed linen and towels,
    just ask.\r\n\r\nVISITORS\r\nWhen having visitors and showing them around, please
    keep only to the areas that are meant for the public = please don’t take visitors
    to the basement or the storage corridors.\r\n\r\nRENTING HUB FEENIX SPACES\r\nIt’s
    possible to rent spaces for your own interest, like art studio, wood workshop,
    treatment space etc. For the workaways, using a space for one hour, costs one
    hour of work. If heating is needed, there’s a separate fee for that. Agree the
    renting with Torsten beforehand. If you would like to rent a space for a longer
    time or for a bigger group of people, that can also be possible -talk to Torsten
    about that too.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\nAlways feel free to ask, if you need help
    or information! There are no silly questions!\r\n\r\nENJOY YOUR STAY!"
